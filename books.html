                                <blockquote>
                                    "Reading 'Ego is the Enemy' was incredibly timely as I navigate my transition from student 
                                    to professional economist. Holiday's insights on the three stages—aspiring, success, and failure—
                                    resonated deeply with my current journey. 
                                    
                                    <br><br>As someone involved in research leadership through the Global Strategy Review and various 
                                    extracurricular roles, the book's emphasis on being a student rather than pretending to be 
                                    the teacher struck home. It reminded me that despite academic achievements and recognition, 
                                    the most important quality is remaining humble and focused on continuous learning.
                                    
                                    <br><br>The concept of 'plus est en vous' (there is more in you) particularly inspired me. 
                                    Working on Lebanon's economic challenges requires looking beyond personal recognition toward 
                                    serving something greater—the community and the country's economic future. This book reinforced 
                                    my commitment to using my economics education not for personal ego, but for meaningful impact.
                                    
                                    <br><br>Holiday's message that ego makes us enemies of mastery is especially relevant in economics, 
                                    where overconfidence can lead to poor policy recommendations. The humility to acknowledge what 
                                    I don't know while building on what I do know will be crucial as I advance in my career."

            <h4>Personal Reflections</h4>
            <blockquote>
                "How to Win Friends and Influence People" provided practical frameworks for the interpersonal 
                aspects of leadership that economics courses don't teach. As someone organizing CEF and 
                coordinating teams across different academic backgrounds for GSR, Carnegie's principles on 
                making people feel important and appreciated have been invaluable.
                
                <br><br>The principle of "becoming genuinely interested in other people" transformed how I 
                approach networking at conferences like YESF and GFF. Instead of focusing on what I could gain, 
                I started asking delegates about their research and challenges. This shift led to more meaningful 
                connections and collaborative opportunities.
                
                <br><br>For my role as ESS Logistics Officer organizing the interfaith Ramadan-Lent celebration, 
                Carnegie's insights on respecting others' opinions and avoiding arguments proved essential. 
                Bringing together 200+ Muslims and Christians required sensitivity and the ability to make 
                everyone feel valued - exactly what Carnegie advocates.
                
                <br><br>The book's emphasis on acknowledging mistakes openly aligns with the humility principle 
                from "Ego is the Enemy." In my volunteer work raising funds for displaced families, being 
                genuine and admitting when approaches weren't working built trust with donors and beneficiaries 
                alike. Carnegie's lessons on influence through empathy rather than force will guide my 
                leadership approach as CEF develops.

                Reading "Poor Economics" transformed how I think about developmental economics. As someone working

                through controlled experiments offers a powerful alternative to the grand theories that often fail

                <br><br>The chapter on education challenges the notion that simply building schools solves problems. 
                In Lebanon, where economic crisis affects educational quality, their findings about teacher 
                accountability and targeted interventions provide actionable insights. Their work on microfinance 
                also challenges assumptions I held about financial inclusion strategies.
                
                <br><br>What struck me most was the focus on understanding how poor people actually make decisions 
                under constraints. This human-centered approach to economics aligns perfectly with my research on 
                sectarian resource allocation and economic development. The book reinforces that effective policy 
                requires understanding local context rather than importing solutions wholesale.
                
                <br><br>For my work with CEF and GSR, this book provides methodological frameworks for testing 
                interventions before scaling. The randomized control trial approach, while challenging to implement, 
                offers Lebanon a path to evidence-based policymaking that could break the cycle of failed reforms.

            <p>
                The evidence-based approach from this book directly influences how I design research for GSR 
                and plan CEF's policy simulation tracks. Testing interventions on small scales before 
                implementing broadly could help Lebanon avoid costly policy mistakes.
